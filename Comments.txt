Couple of notes here:
-- I know I said I was gonna implement routing to another page
But that's a whole new topic and I didn't wanna delay further 
So I pushed this code

It works on one page hiding and showing messages depending whether you are logged in or not

I have added documentation to the code
Basically I created react app
Removed the logo and default text and added the text u see

And then created another tsx file that has the google btn and its functionality
And then included that tsx file/class into the app.tsx

So the logic is:
If you login 
The login state: is true
And susername is no longer null

If username is not null, then show the messages you are logged in as ...

If you press log out
It removes the username
Sets the login state to false and username to null

And if user name is null, then the message won't appear

Its pretty straightforward, if anyone has experience with routing they can carry on from there and tweak the code to route to another page (when logged in) and back (when logged out)

The code has been pushed to gitlab: secure login branch along with these comments
and dont forget to install all the packages used
yarn add react-google-login shud do the trick
